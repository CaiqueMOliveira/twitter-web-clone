## Practicing with the #Twitter :bird:

[**Twitter**](https://twitter.com) is a beautiful and clean-design social media, easy to apply [`flex`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex) concepts. Therefore, I have built a Twitter clone to practice the [`flex`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex) concepts that I have learned in [#Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/)'s course.
